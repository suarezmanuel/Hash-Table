# Hash-Table
A Hash table that works with Double Hashing, I hope to make the code more expandible, easier to extend, and concise.\
Was guided by https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table. Took the general structure and mended it to my needs and to what I saw as a more fitting implementation.

TODO: Unit Testing.
